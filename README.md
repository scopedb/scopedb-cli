# ScopeDB CLI

`scope` is the command-line interface for [ScopeDB](https://www.scopedb.io/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ScopeDB CLI is in public preview. Current releases are release candidates intended for evaluation and may change before the first stable release.

## Install

### Prebuilt binaries

Download the release archive for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/scopedb/scopedb-cli/releases):

| Platform               | Archive pattern                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| macOS on Apple silicon | `scope_<version>_darwin_arm64.tar.gz`            |
| macOS on Intel         | `scope_<version>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`            |
| Linux on x86-64        | `scope_<version>_linux_amd64.tar.gz`             |
| Linux on ARM64         | `scope_<version>_linux_arm64.tar.gz`             |
| Windows on x86-64      | `scope_<version>_windows_amd64.zip`              |
| Windows on ARM64       | `scope_<version>_windows_arm64.zip`              |

Compare the archive's SHA-256 digest with its entry in `checksums.txt`, extract it, and place `scope` (`scope.exe` on Windows) in a directory on your `PATH`.

For example, after extracting the archive on macOS or Linux:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
install -m 0755 scope "$HOME/.local/bin/scope"
scope version
```

Ensure `$HOME/.local/bin` is on your `PATH` before running `scope`.

### Install from source

With Go 1.27 or newer:

```sh
go install github.com/scopedb/scopedb-cli/cmd/scope@latest
```

## Get started

Sign in to ScopeDB Cloud and run a query:

```sh
scope login
scope status
scope query 'SELECT 1 AS ready'
scope query 'FROM system.tables LIMIT 10'
```

`scope login` prompts for an email address and verification code, then stores the session in the operating system keyring. To select another workspace:

```sh
scope workspace list
scope workspace use <id-or-name>
scope status
```

## Query output

Queries can be provided inline, from a file, or through stdin. Results can be rendered as a table, JSON, JSON Lines, or CSV.

```sh
scope query --file report.scopeql --format json
scope query 'FROM system.tables LIMIT 10' --format csv --output tables.csv
```

Run `scope --help` or `scope <command> --help` for the complete command reference. See the [ScopeDB documentation](https://docs.scopedb.io/) for ScopeQL and service documentation.

## Automation

For CI and other non-interactive environments, set the data-plane endpoint and API key:

```sh
export SCOPEDB_ENDPOINT="https://your-workspace.example.com"
export SCOPEDB_API_KEY="your-api-key"

scope doctor
scope query --format json 'SELECT 1 AS ready'
```

Both variables are required.

## Development

Development tools are managed with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/):

mise run check
mise run test:race
mise run build
```
